making a game threads apart of the program thread

synchronized for thread safety



//path is passed in the load method in the spritesheet because the path might be not initialized yet



entities move but tiles don't


we must make an initial state because the game runs before update and render is called

we can use quad trees to get the near entiteis in an efficient way
